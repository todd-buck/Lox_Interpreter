# KLox Interpreter

By Todd Buck, Mithul Nallaka, and Caroline Lewis.

## Description

An implementation of the Lox programming language as outlined by Robert Nystorm in Crafting Interpreters. This implementation was written using the Kotlin programming language.

## Project Layout

The code written for the interpreter can be going in the main directory. To execute the interpreter, use the Lox.kt file.
A testing suite for the interpreter has been written with both unit tests and program tests. Refer to the Testing folder to find these tests.
The unit tests can be found in the root directory of the folder. The corresponding code segments to the unit test are found in the respective file under TestFiles.
All JUnit testing outputs have been collected into an HTML document in the TestOutput folder. All tests can be verified by opening the respective testing file in TestOutput.
The InputFiles folder is the source of file inputs for the ScannerTests, and the ProgramTesting folder is a working folder of programattic testing. 
The main sources of testing can be found in the JUnit files.
