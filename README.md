## Project Layout

### Testing Folder

This is where you will find a testing suite for the interpreter. It contains code that will execute both unit tests and program tests. In the root directory of the Testing folder, you will find the unit tests (ClassesTests.kt, ScannerTests.kt, etc). 

If you would like to view the code segments for the unit tests, view the .txt file with the same name under the TestFiles folder (classesTests.txt, functionTests.txt, etc). 

All JUnit testing outputs have been collected into an HTML document in the TestOutput folder (Test Results - ScannerTests.html, Test Results - ClassesTests.html, etc). All tests can be verified by opening these files. To view the results, open these files in your browser.

The InputFiles folder is the source of file inputs for the ScannerTests, and the ProgramTesting folder is a working folder of programattic testing.
